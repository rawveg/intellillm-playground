description: Gets the LLM to learn the codebase
---

Please summarise the functionality of the current codebase, do not simply rely on documentation, examine that certainly, but then confirm that the features of this codebase correspond to the documented functionality. Do not make any assumptions, take a breath and think carefully, if you have questions about the codebase, investigate those questions as you will receive your answers by thoroughly exploring both the codebase and your own memory. Think carefully about each feature and do not exclude any files, consider how the application is also used, is it containerised? Are there additional files, technically not part of the codebase, that will give you additional valuable context. Once you have arrived at a full determination of the functionality, then please summarise that information and present it to me. Please take into account recent memories, including features that may or may not have been implemented within the codebase. Establish whether your memories are accurate by directly comparing them to actual code within the codebase (if present). Take your time and be thorough. When you believe you have an understanding of the implementation here, re-examine your beliefs rather than make assumptions based on false data or worse, based on other assumptions.
